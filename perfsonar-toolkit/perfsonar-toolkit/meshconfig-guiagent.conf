## Use 'mesh' blocks to to specify each mesh that the agent should configure
## a display for
# #<mesh>
#     ## Use 'configuration_url' to specify the URL where the agent should obtain
#     ## the mesh configuration from
#     configuration_url             https://host.domain.edu/example.json
#
#     ## To ensure that the configuration is trusted, you can set the
#     ## 'validate_certificate' option to 1. This will validate that the certificate
#     ## is valid, and matches the hostname. If the 'validate_certificate' option is
#     ## set to 1, the 'ca_certificate_file' option must be set.
#     #validate_certificate         0
#
#     ## The 'ca_certificate_file' specifies which CAs to use to validate the
#     ## certificates.
#     #ca_certificate_file          /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt    # the default RedHat CAs
# #</mesh>

## You can define more meshes to configure against by adding more 'mesh' blocks.
<mesh>
    configuration_url             https://localhost/k8s.json
#    #validate_certificate         0
#    #ca_certificate_file          /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
</mesh>

# Use the maddash_yaml to specify the location of the files to write. In a
# normal configuration, these should be left as what's included below.
maddash_yaml                 /etc/maddash/maddash-server/maddash.yaml

## Frequency with which to check the remote meshes, for changes. If any found it will
## attempt to rebuild the MaDDash configuration. See also check_config_interval which is
## the frequency with which to check for local configuration file changes
#check_interval 3600

## Frequency in seconds with which to poll this file for changes. If any changes are
## detected, it will attempt to rebuild maddash.yaml. Should generally be less than
## check_interval to be useful.
#check_config_interval 60

## The 'send_error_emails' option can be used to tell the agent to send an email
## (via sendmail) when an error occurs. These emails will be sent to the
## applicable administrators (e.g. the local administrator(s), the mesh
## administrator(s), the site administrator(s), and/or the host
## administrator(s).
#send_error_emails             1

## The 'send_error_emails_to_mesh' option can be used to tell the agent to send
## an email to the mesh configuration administrators. If this is left unset,
## the only emails that will be sent out are to those listed in this
## configuration file.
#send_error_emails_to_mesh     1

## By default, the from address for the error emails will be
## mesh_agent@[hostname]. However, if you'd like to specify a different email
## address, you can do so here.
#email_from_address           admin@host.site.edu

## One or more 'admin_email' options can be included to specify email addresses
## to send errors to. These email addresses will receive all errors (including
## parsing errors). This is in addition to the emails that will be sent to the
## various affected administrators (e.g. the mesh administrator or the site
## administrator).
#admin_email         admin1@site.edu
#admin_email         admin2@site.edu


# The default maddash test configurations. If the values aren't specified in
